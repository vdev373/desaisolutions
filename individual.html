					<p>For those who don’t have employer-sponsored health plans, an individual health insurance policy is a necessity. We’ll help you sort out the confusion of co-pays, coinsurance and other considerations and create a policy that fits your life.

						If you don’t get healthcare coverage through your employer, or if you’re self-employed, individual health insurance is an absolute must. Don’t panic about the costs; plans can be cheaper than you expect if you shop around, and you’ll often have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the balance of premium costs and coverage.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h4>The four big variables to watch out for are:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The deductible (how much you pay out-of-pocket before the insurer starts paying).</li>
						<li>Co-payments (the percentage, if any, that you pay toward each medical or hospital bill, with the insurer picking up the rest).</li>
						<li>Any annual limits on the total amount the insurer pays.</li>
						<li>Exactly which medical services, treatment and drugs the policy covers.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Depending on your health level and appetite for risk, you can often find a policy and price that’s just right for you.
						
						When offering individual health insurance, insurers have a particular interest in making sure you stay healthy. That means they’ll often pay up to 100 percent of the costs of preventative healthcare, such as checkups, screenings and vaccines.
						
						Health insurance is certainly a complicated topic, so if you want to find out more about getting the ideal plan, contact us today.

						Individual life insurance is arguably the biggest investment you can make in your loved ones’ security. It’s a complicated field, but don’t let that put you off. We’ll be happy to talk you through the options.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					First, you’ll need to determine the type of life insurance you want to buy, with the most common types being term life insurance, whole life insurance and universal life insurance.
					</p>

					<h3>Term Life Insurance</h3>
					<p>
					To put it very simply, with term life insurance you pay regular premiums for a set period and the policy only pays out if you die during this period.
					</p>

					<h3>Whole Life Insurance</h3>
					<p>
						With whole life insurance, there’s no set period. You usually pay regular premiums until you die, at which point the policy pays out. Sometimes you have the option to take a lump sum back while you are still alive, but this will reduce the amount paid out when you die.
					</p>

					<h3>Universal Life Insurance</h3>
					<p>
						Universal life insurance works in a similar way to whole life insurance, but you have more flexibility about taking money early. You can even borrow money and repay it later; although, if there’s any loan outstanding when you die, the policy’s payout can be significantly affected.
					</p>

					<p>
						The premiums you pay depend heavily on your age and medical history, along with the amount you want the policy to pay out. So, it’s important to seek expert advice before committing to life insurance.
					</p>

					<p>
						Contact us and we’ll walk you through the options and help you to determine if term life insurance, whole life insurance or universal life insurance are right for you.
