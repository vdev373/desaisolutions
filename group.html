				<p>In general, group health insurance is the first priority for employees and is the second largest expense for employers behind payroll. We’ll help you navigate the healthcare process so you can hire and retain top talent.

					If you don’t get healthcare coverage through your employer, or if you’re self-employed, individual health insurance is an absolute must. Don’t panic about the costs; plans can be cheaper than you expect if you shop around, and you’ll often have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the balance of premium costs and coverage.</p>

				<p>
					Some employee benefits feel like a nice bonus, but in most cases, employees see healthcare as a core part of the compensation package–arguably as important as the salary itself. Buying group health insurance is the economical way for your business to recruit and retain staff, and increase the likelihood that they’ll be fit to work.
				</p>
					Depending on the plan, your business can cover employees only or can choose to offer coverage to the family and financial dependents of employees, as well. Additionally, your company can choose to cover the premiums in full or split the cost with employees.
				</p>
					The costs associated with group health insurance vary depending on where your business is based, how many employees you want to cover, and how old the employees are.
				</p>
					Since the Affordable Care Act took effect, the medical history and pre-existing conditions of the employees don’t matter. Because you’re pooling the risk with group health insurance, the price your business pays per employee is usually much less than the average amount they’d pay if they bought insurance individually.
				</p>
					Group health insurance also comes with tax benefits. The premiums you pay as an employer are fully tax deductible. Very small businesses can also get a tax credit worth up to half the cost of the premiums.
